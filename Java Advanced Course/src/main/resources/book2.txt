ALEXANDER POPE, Efq; 

OUR hero was descended from a goo 4 d 
family in Oxfordfhire. His fathers 
Chriftian name was Alexander* who was 
an eminent merchant, and a diflant relati 
on of the Ear] of Downe, whofefoleheirefs 
married the Earl of Lindfay. Our poet s 
mother, Editha, was the daughter of Wil 
liam Turner, Efq; of York. She had three 
brothers, one of whom was killed, a fecond 
died in the fervice of King Charles the 
firft, and the eldcft was a general officer 
in the Spanim army.

her during her pregnancy. Our bard was 
born in London, the 2 i ft of May i 68 8, 
and was chriftened by the name of Alex 
ander. He was of a tender and delicate 
conftitiition, which occafioned his being 
fo late of going to fchool, He was taught 
to read at home by an old aunt, and learn 
ed to write without any affiftance, by co 
pying printed books. He took uncommon 
delight in reading. The family being of 
the Pvomifh religion, at eight years of age 
he was put under one Taverner, a prieft, 
who lived in Hampfhire, who taught him 
the rudiments of the Latin and Greek 
tongues together ; and he foon after was 
fent to a popim feminary near Winchefter, 
from whence he was removed to a fchool 
near Hyde-park corner. He received ve - 
r" little benefit under thofe mafters, which 
made him write a fatire, expofing their in- 
fufficiency: for he fays that he was obli 
ged to begin over-again,and was one that 
might be faidto be felf-taught. 

HE bad very early an inclination for 

" 



A L E X. P O P E, E s Q, 3 

poetry ; and happening to meet with O- 
gilby s tranflation of Virgil, and Sandy s 
tranflation of Ovid, he read them with 
pleafure and delight: and the effe&lt;5l they 
had upon his young fancy, though none 
of them were very elegant, made him fpeak 
of them with pleafure in the clofe of life: 
the produdiOns of his childhood were a- 
bove one founh part of Ovid s metamor- 
phofis, and the Thebaid of Statius. 

IN this period of his life he was ena 
moured with the drama, and turned the 
Iliad into a kind of play, perfuading fome 
of his fchool-fellows to aft parts of it. 
His father, who had a nice ear in poetry, 
frequently caufed young Alexander to go 
over his rhimes a fecond time, and make 
great alterations in them ; after which he 
would read them over with pleafure, and 
approve of them. 

His father, after the revolution, con- 

verted his goods into cafh, and retired to 

Binfield, in Windfor foreft, being then in 

an indifferent flate of health. He loved

filence and folitude, and was a man of an 
extream good moral chara&er. But as he 
was a Papifl, his confcience would not al 
low him to put his money (which was con- 
fiderable) in the funds. He therefore 
locked it up in a cheft, and lived upon the 
principal: fo that before his death he had 
confumed moft part of it. 

IN the year 1700, Mr Popepublifhed the 
following poern on folitude, which expref- 
fes his own inebriation, as he was fond of 
retirement aru- privacy.

AT fourteen he had acquired a readinefs

London to learn French and Italian; to 
which his family objected, on account of 
his bad flate of health : but he mattered 
thofe languages with furprifing difpatch.

bard liking Dryden was, becaufe the 
of that poet was moft congenial with his 
own. He always mentioned him with a 
kind of rapturous veneration. About the 
age of i 5, he began to write his poem cal 
led Alcanor, and this performance was a 
full proof of his chlldifh folly, of which 
he fpeaks with fo much candour, as the 
ingenuous reader will be glad to fee, from 
apaflage preferved in his preface to his own 
works,. 

" I confefs there was a time when- I 
* was in love with myfelf, and my firft 
" productions were the children of felf- 
" love upon innocence. I had made an 
" epic poem, and panegyrics en all the 
* princes of Europe, and I thought myfelf 
&lt;{ the greateft genius that ever was. I 
" cannot but repeat thefe delightful vifions 
" of my childhood, which, like the fine 
** colours we fee when our eyes are (hut, 
" are variimed for ever." 

BETWEEN this and his aoth year, he. 
fpent his time in reading the moft coufi-

derable poets in the Greek, Latin, French, 
Italian, and Engliih languages, 
made a tranflation ofTully de feneaute. It 
is a common obfervation that fome feeds 
of vanity and felf conceit are neceflary in 
gredients in the compofition of a poet. 

HE learned his philofophy chiefly from 
Mr Locke, and by this means he became 
delighted with that precifion of thought; 
though nature had formed and difpofed 
him for method in his competitions, and 
Mr. Locke s immortal effay had warmed 
and fortified his innate love of truth. 

HE compofed feveral other poetical pie 
ces: Thefe are printed among his juvenile 
poems in thefirft and fecond volumes of his 
works; after they had made their appear 
ance without his name, fome in the fixtfc 
volume of Tonfon s Mifcellanies,in 1711.

and he ehofe rather to do them in verfe, 
as eafier to him than profe. The imitati 
ons were generally condemned; and it is 
ao wonder fo young an author fhould mif- 
take his fondnefs for his genius. He was 
fenfible of it afterwards, and feefns to hint 
at the miftake, in the preface to the firft vo 
lume of his poems publifhed in 171?* 
where he takes particular notice of this, 
as one of the difficulties and dangers that 
attend *he profeffiph of a poet. Mr. Pope s 
mifcarriage is faid to have animated ano 
ther to make a like attempt, which produ* 
ced fix very humorous epigrams upon a 
pipe of tobacco, in the manner of fix dif- 
tinguiflied poets, each admirably perform

THIS early piece was long after 
wards communicated by him to t)r. 
Atterbury, with a declared intention to 
burn it, in which that friend concurred:

leave, among my curiofities. So far feem- 
ed a little cruel, and to foften it, the Bi- 
fhop concludes with this high -drained 
foothing panegyric. In truth, it is the on 
ly inifonce of that kind I ever met with 
from a perfon good for any thing elfe, nay, 
for every thing elfe to which he is pleafed 
to turn himfcif. After all, though the 
written copy might undergo this cruel ex 
ecution,, yet the original, it feems, was 
faithfully preferved in the author s memo

he had received from credible information 
be true, that fome of the anonymous ver- 
fes quoted as examples of the Art of fink 
ing in poetry, in the incomparable fatire fo 
called, were fuch as our poet remembered 
from his own Alcander. Nor was the 
vanity of writing an epic poem cured by 
this failure in the firft attempt. On the 
contrary, the errors and imperfections he: 
obferved in it, feem to have remained up

cond attempt, in compofing -which, the 
faults of the firft would be of no ufe, by 
way of a leflbn to avoid them. However 
that be, we are afTured by his editor, that 
he had framed a defign of writing an epic 
poem on our old Annalifts, and therefore 
more engaging to an Englifhman ; thfs 
was on the arrival of Brutus, the fuppofed 
grandfon of -*3Lnea?, in ourifland, and the 
fettlement of the firft founders of the 
Britifh monarchy. In this poem he de- 
figned to treat amply of all that regarded 
civil regimen of the fcience of politicks^ 
the feveral forms of a republick were here 
to be examined and explained, together 
with the feveral modes of religioiis 
worfliip, as far as they affedt fociety. 
And the whole was to be written in rhyme. 
The author of the effay jufi cited,, thinks 
that the fuccefs of this attempt would have 
been no better than the former. And to 
fupportthatcenfurehe obferves, that Pope s 
genius was chiefly of the didactic kind,

tic, which are the main nerves of the E- 
popcea; that he would have given us ma 
ny elegant defcriptions and many general 
characters well drawn ; but would have 
failed to fet before our eyes the reality of 
thefe objeas, and the actions of thefe cha 
racters ; that Pope s clofe anclconftant rea- 
foning had by this time impaired and 
crumed the faculty of imagination-, that 
the political reflections would, in all pro 
bability, have been more numerous, than 
the affecting ftrokes of nature; that it 
would have more refembled the Henriade 
than the Iliad, or even the Gierufalemme 
Liberata; that it would have appeared, if 
this fcheme had been executed, how much 
and for what reafons the man that is fkil- 
ful in painting modern life, and the moil: 
fecret foibles and follies of his contempo

enthufiafm, and produce endlefs tautologies 
and circumlocutions. This writer con 
cludes with imagining Dr. Warburtofc s 
opinion to be the fame with his, fince 
there could not have been a more impro 
per fubjecl: for an epic poem, than the 
particulrrs of which that editor informs us 
it was chiefly to confift. The fame wri 
ter remarks* that the firft poem that ap 
peared in France any thing like an epic 
poem, was on this identical fubjecl of Brii- 
tus*s arriving in England. It was writ 
ten by Euftache, in the reign of Louis VII. 
who came to the throne in I i 3 7, and was 
hufband of the celebrated Eleonora, after 
wards divorced and married to our Henry 

II. 

IN 1704, he wrote the firft part of his 
"Windfor Foreft, though the whole was n6t 
jublifhed till 171 ft. 

DURING his refidence in the foreft, 
our poet compofed a comedy and a trage 
dy. "With refpec! to the fabject of the

former, we are wholly in the dark; the 
latter, however, was founded on a ftory 
taken from the legend of St. Genevieve. 
But whether he diltrufted his talents for 
dramatic poetry, or whether he was cauti 
ous of hazarding his fame on the fickle 
tafte of a captious audience, he could ne 
ver be prevailed on to write for the ftage&gt; 
though he was importuned by feveral. 

His father s retired abode intheforeftbe-

neighbourhood of Sir William Trumball s 
eftate, that knight foon became a valuable ac 
quaintance to our young poet; and his firft 
entrance into the polite worl&lt;l, even whilft 
he was under tuition, is to be dated from his 
intimacy with Sir William. 

As this gentleman was young Pope s 

firft patron, and uihered him into the great 

theatre of the world, we think it not amifs 

to give our readers a fhort account of him.

HE was from thence fent envoy to Flo-

was fent ambafTador to the Ottoman Porte by

CH USING to enjoy, in a philofophic 
Retirement, the remainder of his days at 
Eaft Hamflead, where he had been born, he 
withdrew thither, andin the month of De 
cember, in the year 1716, expired^ in the 
feventyfeventh year of his age. Young Mr. 
Pope, in his poem on the foreft, celebrated 
that retirement. His firft paftoral, written 
by him at the youthful age of fixteen years, 
was, with the warmed fenfe of gratitude, 
addrefled to his worthy patron Sir William 
TrumbalU

HE had now read all the belt authors, 
and was improving himfdf with the con- 
verfation of tne mod celebrated men in the 
age, Dr. Garth, Meff. Wycherley, Walfn, 
and Gay, Lord Halifax, Lord Lanfdown, 
Sir Richard Steel, Meff. Addifon and 
Congreve. Tn the year 1724} our po 
et, in the view of fettling another fence 
about his fortune, purchafed an annuity 
of a hundred pounds a year for his own 
life, that of his mother being included. 

IN i 7 i 7 , he publiihed a collection of all 
he had printed feparately* and proceeded to 
give a new edition of Shakefpear, which, 
being published in I 72 r, difcovered that he 
had confulted his fortune, more than his 
fame, in that undertaking. The Iliad be 
ing finifhed, he engaged upon the like foot 
ing to undertake the OdyiTey. Mr Broome 
and Mr Fenton did part of it, and received 
five hundred pounds of Mr. Pope for their 
labours. It was publifhed in the fame man 
ner, and on the fame conditions to Lin- 
tot j excepting that, in (lead of twelve

hundred pounds, he had but fix hundreds- 
for the copy. This work being finifhed 
in 1 7 2 5, he was afterwards employed with 
Swift and Arbuthnot in piinting fome 
volumes of Mifcellaries. About this 
time, he narrowly efcaped lofing his life, as 
he was returning home in a friend s chari 
ot; which, on pafling a bridge, happened 
to be overturned, and thrown with the hor- 
fes into, the river. The glafTes were up, 
and he not able to break, them: fo that he 
had immediately been drowned, if the pofti- 
lion had not broke them, and dragged him 
him out to the bank. A iragment of the 
glafs however cut him fo defperately,.rhat 
he ever after loft the ufe of two of his fin 
gers. 

No part of our bard s life is more inte- 
refting than that of his conduct in cultiva 
ting friendfhips, efpecialJy, with his brother 
poets. At the age of eighteen he was 
grown fo high in the efteem of Wycherley, 
that he thought him capable of cor- 
refting his poems (which had been damn- 



A L E X. P O P E, E s &lt;fe 17 

ed) fo as they might appear again in print, 
Pope complied with the requeft, and exe 
cuted it with equal freedom and judg 
ment. But the faults proved too many for 
the author of them to be told of; he was 
old, became jealous,, and conftrued his 
young mailer s ingenuity, and plain deal 
ing, into want of re peft. Not only the 
defign of pubiifhing was dropt, but all cor- 
refpondence with the corre&or fufpended. 
This ungenerous return was lively refent- 
ed by Pope. And though Wycherley 
was prevailed with afterwards, by the me 
diation of a common friend, to refuse the 
correfpondence, yet this went no farther 
than bare complaifance. However, fome 
time after Mr Wycherley s death, his 
poems being publiihed by a mercenary 
hand in 17*8, our author the following 
year printed feveral letters that had patted 
between them, in vindication of Mr Wy- 
cherley s good name, againft fome mif- 
conftru&ions prefixed to that edition. Our 
jioet s cond.uft, throughout this whole try-

ing affair, was greatly above his years. But 
young as he was, his talents were now be 
ginning to ripen into full maturity. This 
appeared confpicuoufly in his Eflay on Cri- 
ticifm, which though wrote fo early as 
1708, yet placed him among thofe of the 
firft rank in his art. It is indeed etteem- 
td a matter-piece in its kind, and fo difco- 
vered the peculiar turn of his genius. He 
was not yet twenty years old, fo that eve 
ry body flood amazed to find fuch a know 
ledge of the world, fuch a maturity of 
judgment, and fuch a penetration into hu 
man nature as are there difplayed ; info- 
nsuch that it became a fubjecT: for the cri- 
ticks to difplay their profoundeft (kill in ac 
counting for it. The greateft geniufes in 
painting, as well as poefy, were generally 
cbferved not to have produced any of their 
matter-pieces before the age of thirty or 
thereabouts, and that Mr. Pope s genius ri 
pened earlier, was % owing, tis faid, to a 
happy conjuncture of concurring circum- 
ftances. He was happily fecured from. fair

ling into the debaucheries of women and 
wine (the too frequent bane of hopeful 
youth) by the weaknefs and delicacy of his 
conftitution, and the bad ftate of his health. 
The fenfual vices were tco violent for fo 
tender a frame, he never fell into intempe 
rance or diffipation, which is of the great- 
eft co-nfequence in prefei ving each faculty 
of the mind in due vigour. Even his 
miOiapen figure is alleged to be of ufe to 
him as a writer. It is an obfervation of 
Lord Bacon, that whofoever hath any 
thing fixed in his perfon that induces con 
tempt, hath alfo a perpetual fpur within to 
refcue and deliver himfclf from it. Hence 
it has been thought not improbable, that 
cur poet might be animated by this cir- 
cumftance to double his diligence, to make 
himfelf diflinguifhed by the reftitude of 
his undemanding, and beautiful turn of 
his mind, as much as he was by the defor 
mity of his body. It is certain that he 
ftriaiy fulfilled the precept of HORACE in

fudavit & alfit. It was another circum- 
flance equally propitious to the ftudies of 
Pope, in this early part of his life, that he 
inherited a fortune that was a decent com 
petency, and fufficientto fupply the fmall 
expences which, both by conftitution and 
reflection, he required. Thus he was 
preferved from the two moft deftru&ive 
enemies to a young genius, want and de- 
pendance. Nor was the circumftance of 
being placed beneath opulence, and an high 
ftftfion, lefs propitious, fince thefe almoft 
unavoidably embanafs and immerfe the 
pofleffor in the cares, the pleafures, the in 
dolence, and the diffipation, that accom 
pany abundance. Thus it is conceived,, 
that thefe external aids, as fo many auxili 
aries, affifting the active inborn ftrength 
of our poet s genius, had their mare in this 
triumphant production. But how trium 
phant foever may be the merit of the EfTay 
on Criticifm, yet it was (till furpaffed in a 
poetical view by the Rape of the Lock. 
The fotmer indeed excelled in the didacYic

way, for which he was peculiarly formed ; 
a clear head and ftrong fenfe were his cha- 
rafteriftical qualities ; his chief force lay 
in the underflanding, rather than in the 
imagination. But it is the creative pow 
er of the laft that conftitutes the proper 
character! ftick of poetry, and therefore it is 
in the Rape of the Lock that Pope prin 
cipally appears a poet ; fmce in this per^ 
formance he has difplayed more imagina 
tion than in all his other works put toge 
ther. The poem took its birth from an 
incidental quarrel that happened between 
two noble families, that of Lord Petreand 
Mrs. Fermor, both of our author s ac 
quaintance, and of the fame religion. His 
lordfliip, in a party of pleafure, carried it 
fo far, as to cut off a favourite lock of the 
lady s hair. This, tho done in the way 
of gallantry, was ferioufly refented, as be- 
ing indeed a real injury. Hence there 
prefently grew mutual animofities, which 
being feen with concern by a common 
friend to all ; that friend requefted Pope

to try the power of his mufe on the occa- 
on, intimating, that a proper piece of ri 
dicule was the likelieft means to extin- 
guilh the rifing flame. Pope readily com 
plied with the friendly propofal; and the 
jun&ure requiring difpatch, his firft deilgn 
was compleated in lefs than a fortnight, 
which being fent to the lady, had more 
than the propofed effecl:. Pleafed to the 
higheft degree with the delicacy of the 
compliment paid to her, (he firft commu 
nicated copies of it to her acquaintance, 
and then prevailed with our author to 
print it : as he did, though not without 
the caution of concealing his name to fo 
hafty a (ketch. But the univerfal applaufe 
which the fketch met with, put him upon 
enriching it with the machinery of the 
iSylphs; and in that new drefs the two 
cantoes, extended to five, came out the 
following year, 1712, ufhered by a letter 
to Mrs Fermor; to whom he afterwards 
addrelTed another, which is efteemed far 
fuperior to any of Voiture. 






A LEX. P OPE, Esc^ 23 
IT appears by Mr. Pope s frequent fto- 
len marches on the public, how cautious 
he was of making his fame fecure, and not 
to hazard his name, by prefixing it to any 
fmall work, till the fuccefs thereof was fet 
tled. 

THIS prudent conduct of his evinces, 
beyond the power of contradiction, that he 
\vas determined to enjoy either a proper 
fame, or to die in oblivion. Since him 
this practice has been ufed by feveral. 
Some of Mr. Pope s pieces had remained 
in a ftate of probation for feveral years; 
for he was very flow to confefs what many 
would not have loft the pleafure of imme 
diately owning on any confideration. 

BUT Mr. Pope, although not fo eager 
and greedy as moft of the Parnaflian gen 
try, who are in general impatient for ap- 
plaufe, and irritable by cenfure, was yet de- 
firous of laying claim to the reputation of 
the bed living poet, which he undoubted 
ly was, having not even a diftant competi 
tor. " 



24 THE LIFE OF 

IN i 7 29, by the advice of Lord Doling- 
broke, he turned his pen to fubje&s of mo* 
rality; and accordingly we find him, with 
the afiiftance of that noble friend, who fur- 
nimed him with the materials, at work 
this year upon the " Effay on Man." The 
following extract of a letter to Swift dif- 
covers the reafon of his lordfhip s advice : 
" Bid him," fays Bolingbroke, " talk 
" to you of the work he is about, I hope 
" in good earneft; it is a fine one, and will 
" be, in his hands, an original. His fole 
" complaint is, that he finds it too eafy in 
" the execution. This flatters his lazi- 
" nefs: it flatters my judgment; who al* 
" ways thought that, univerfal as his ta- 
&lt;c lents are, this is eminently and peculiar- 
" ly his, above all the writers I know* li- 
" vingor dead; I do not ex. ept Horace. 
Pope tells the Dean, in the next letter, 
that " the work, Lord Bolingbroke 
&lt;* fpeaks of with fuch abundant partiality, is 
" a fyftem of ethics, in the Horatian way." 
In purfuing the fame defign, he wrote his 



ALEX. POPE, ESQ.. 25 

&lt;f Ethic Epiaies :" the fourth of which, 
* Upon Tafte," giving great offence, as 
he was fuppofed to ridicule the Duke of 
Chandois under the character of Timon, 
is faid to have put him upon writing fa- 
tires, which he continued till 1759. He 
ventured to attack perfons of the higheft 
rank, and fet no bounds to his fatirical 
rage. A genuine collection of his letters 
was publifhed in 1737. 

IN this year he alfo publifhed his 
** Temple of Fame," having, according 
to his ufual caution, kept it two years in 
his ftudy. That object of the univerfal 
paflion, was full upon his thoughts at this 
time. He had been from the firfl fetting 
out in full ftretch after it, and faw it now 
within his reach ; accordingly we find him 
in high fpirits, diverting hlmfelf with the 
ladies, to one of whom he fent a copy of 
his " Temple," with an humorous gay e* 
pigram.

good humour which chiefly pleafed Pope,

and to this we owe that excellent little 
poem called, " The dying Chriftian to his 
foul :" The requeft for it was made in the 
frank ingenuous way, and the perform 
ance was returned in the fame fpirit ; ** I 
" don t fend you word, fays Pope, I will, 
" but I have already done it." 

IN the hurry of this race he run his 
head againft the old faw, " the more hafte 
" the worfe fpeed." It was apparently 
owing to the eager impetuofity of this 
paflion, that he attempted his " Ode upon 
" St. Cecilia s day." Mr Dryden had ob 
tained immortal fame by his " Alexander s 
feaft :" and the fcholar, young as he was, 
fed himfelf with the hopes of hitting the 
fame mark by {hooting in the fame bow. 
But here he met with a very fenfible mor 
tification. The " Ode upon St. Cecilia s 
day" was univerfally condemned for want 
of judgment, whatever wit there may be 
in the compofition, which is very great 
in Mr WarbuYton s opinion. It is not 
improbable that it coft our author a great

deal of pains, fince he feems to have 
worked againft the grain ; whereas he 
complained that his " Effay on Man" was 
too eafy, becaiife, as his friend obferved, 
that defign was exa&lyfuited to his genius ; 
and from this inflance, among fome others^ 
another author has inferred, that Pope s 
genius was not turned to the elevated and 
fublime fpecies of poetry : So hazardous 
is the road to fame. 

IN the firft fatire of the fecond book of 
Horace, he had defcribed Lord Harvey 
and Lady Mary Wortley Montague, fo 
characteristically, under the names of 
Lord Fanny and Sappho, that thefe two 
noble perfonages did not only take up the 
fame weapon 2gainft the aggreflbr, but u- 
fed all their interelt among the nobility, 
and even with the King and Queen, to 
hurt him ; this laft injury was what Pope 
complained of moft j and for that reafon, 
the letter which he wrote in anfwer to it, 
was fhewn to her Majefty, as foon as it 
was finilhed, which concludes in thefe

MR Warburton fpeaking of our au

more grave, moral, and fublime. How 
ever, Dr. Aibuthnot, who did not long 
furvive the epiftle in verfe to him, fome 
time before his death gave his friend a 
hint of what indeed is the greateft fault in 
his fatires, by advifing him to ftudy in 
them more to reform, than chaftife. This 
gentleman feems to have been endowed 
with all the qualities requifite for the

no body can read it without the tendered: 
emotion. His hint upon the fault in 
Pope s fatires, of being too virulent, was 
undeniably juft. But then indeed it mud 
be allowed, that the fault is common to 
Pope with all others, who have engaged 
in this fpecies of writing. They all take 
greater pleafure in chaftiiing, than re 
forming ; though by that means, they are 
fure to turn the edge of their wit upon 
themfelves, fmce it muft be owing to the 
predominance of ill-nature above benevo 
lence. In fhort, the true qualities of a fa- 
tirift, are ufually and not amifs exprefled

SIR Richard Steele was a warm (tickler 
for Mr Pope s "Temple of Fame," which 
he had approved of before its appearance 
in public ; as appears by a letter from. 
the former to the latter, bearing date, 
Nov. 12, 1712.

THE poem accordingly met as good 
treatment from Mr Addifon, whofe friend-

fome time in poffeffion of , for nothing as 
yet appeared to make him alter that opi 
nion.

MR Pope was by this time got fo far 
into favour and reputation with the town, 
that he needed no other recommendation 
than his own merit; and he began, as lie 
was juftly entitled, toailume the name of 
Critic, and to give rules to others in his 
tf Eflay on Criticifm," which abounds 
with wit, beautiful turns, variety of me 
taphors, and mafterly obfervations on 
poetry and criticifm. It is the beffc 
work of the kind that has appeared among 
the ancients or moderns.

36 T HE LIFE OF 

MR. Pope wrote a mod excellent letter 
inverfe fromEloifa to Abelard. It is chiefly 
taken from the original letters between thefe 
two extraordinary perfons, diftinguifhed 
above all their cotempororiesfor their geni 
us, learning, and unhappy pailion. 

THEY are made mention of by Bayle in 
his Hiilorical Dictionary. They flourinYd in 
the twelfth century, and were two of the 
^moft diftinguifhed perfons of that age for 
learning and beauty; but for nothing more 
famous than for their unfortunate love. 

AFTER a long courfe of calamities they 
retired each to a feparate convent, and con.- 
fecrated the remainder of their days to re 
ligion. It was many years after this fe- 
paration,that 3 letter of Abelard s to a friend 
(which contain d the hiftory of his mis 
fortunes) fell into the hands of Eloifa. 

THIS awakening all her tendernefs, oc- 
cafioned thofe celebrated letters which give 
fo lively a defcription of grace and nature, 
virtue and paffion. There is a fpirit of 
tendernefs, and a delicacy of fentiment, 



ALEX. P OP E, Eso; 37 

runs through all the letters. But the pro 
digious conflict, the war within, the diffi 
culty of making love, yield to religious 
vows; and an impoffibility of forgetting a 
firft real paffion (hine above all the reft. 

ABELARD had been Eloifa s tutor in 
philofophy and divinity; but each being 
overcome by a paffion for the other, their 
chief ftudy was turned at lad to give and 
receive mutual delight ; which being difco- 
ver d, brought on a tragick ftene: for her 
relations^ tho juftly incens d at Abelard s 
violation of hofpitality, and breach of truft, 
yet pufh d their revenge to an aft of bar 
barity, by maiming the lover in a part, 
which to him was worfe than death. 

ABELARD S being rendered impotent 
by the cruelty of Eloifa s friends, did not 
in the lead abate the warmth of her paffion 
for him, but feemed rather to enhance it, 
from a fpirit of refentmentfor his barbarous 
ufage on her account. 

THEY were both interred in the fame 
grave, or in monuments adjoining, in the 



3* T H E L I F E O F 

monaftery of Paraclete, founded by Abe- 
lard. He died in i j 42, fhe in i i 63. 

So much in regard to their hi-ftory; but 
to return to the merit of Mr. Pope. It 
may be aflerted, that it is not in the power 
of our language to go beyond this poem in 
tendernefs and harmony, Theonly produc 
tion of even our author, that can be put ie 
competition with it, is the piece fo juftly 
admir d for its beauties caird, Vcrfes tothe 
memory of an unfortunate lady. 

THE young lady celebrated in this af 
fecting piece, appears to have been a great 
favourite of Mr. Pope s, who has paid his 
Iribute to friendship, by injuring immor 
tality to her unhappy cataftrophe. Whether 
he himfelf was the belov d perfon fhe was 
feparated from, or not, cannot be well 
afcertained; from his verfes the ftrong hold 
fhe had of his affection is manifeft. 

THI s unfortunate fair one was a young 
lady of quality,, had a very confiderable 
fortune 3 and, as we learn here from Mr.. 
Pope, was eminent for her beauty. 



A LEX. POPE, ESQ.. 39 

HER parents dying while (he was young, 
(he was left under the guardianfhip of an 
uncle. She was brought up fuitable to her 
birth, title, and fortune, and was efteemed 
a match for any nobleman in the kingdom. 
SHE had when very young contracted 
an acquaintance, and fome degree of inti 
macy, with a young gentleman (who has 
never been more than gueffed at by the 
curious, which uncertainty turned the fuf- 
picion on Mr. Pope) and having conceiv d 
a fbndnefs for him, (lie would not liften to 
a very advantageous match propofed by her 
uncle. 

THE incenfed guardian fet fpies upon 
her, by whofe means he foon difcovered 
her carrying on a correfpondence with a 
lover of a rank in life inferior to hers ; 
which, when taxed with, (he did not deny. 
THE guardian uncle, on finding her 
deaf to all his advice to her to ftifle fo ill- 
placed a paffion, foon contrived the means 
of fending her abroad, where fhe was moft 



40 T H E L I FE OF 

politely received, and with all the refpecfc 
due to one of her condition. 

SHE was indeed fecluded induftrioufly 
from feeing or converting with any body 
but the creatures of this fevere guardian; 
fo that no epiftle from her lover could ever 
reach her hand, (he being fo clofely 
watched by the uncle s treacherous mer 
cenaries-, who, when they had promifed 
the lover to deliver his letters to the lady,, 
fcnt them all to England to her uncle ; 
who, in confequence, gave orders for her 
bei-ng more ftriclly guarded, that (he 
might not receive any intelligence from 
that quarter. 

DESPAIRING to hear from the youth 
{he loved, and impatient of her confine 
ment, fhe yielded herfelf up a prey to the 
moft confummate grief. She ufed to 
weep and figh continually ; but not to 
linger any time in fo racking a fituation, 
flie refolved, as Mr Pope terms it, to a& 
the Roman part, by putting an end to her 
life, which fhe did by bribing a woman-

was found dead upon the floor, but warm.

where (he had committed this filicide, 
denying her Chriftian burial, (he was in

tendants to wait on her corpfe to the 

grave. 

A FEW indeed of the neighbouring 
people, ftruck with compaflion for her un 
happy fate, faw her buried in the com 
mon ground, and ftrewed with flowers the 
grave they made for her. 

HE alfo publifhed " The Merchant s 
" Tale," from Chaucer, the " Wife of 
" Bath s Prologue," " Tranflations of fe- 
veral of Ovid s epiftles," a " prologue to 
" Cato," and an " Epilogue to Jane 
Shore." 

THE " Ode on St. Cecilia s Day" is a 
mafterly performance, and Mr Pope de- 



42 T HE L IFE O F 

ferves the more applaufe on account of the 
peril he expofed his reputation to in this 
attempt, Mr Dryden having gained fuch 
univerfal, and indeed merited fame, for 
his " Alexander s Feaft," that the efforts 
o-f all other poets on that fubjeft were 
fcoffed at, nay, condemned before publi 
cation. 

NOTWITHSTANDING fo critical a 
dilemma, Mr Pope publifhed his, which 
is allowed to be the only one that can be 
put in any competition with Mr Dryden s. 
His other attempts in lyric poetry are two 
41 ChorufTes for the Tragedy of Brutus," 
by his Grace Sheffield Duke of Bucking 
ham. 

MR. Pope s works are fufficient vouch 
ers for his genius, tafte, and judgment. 
The Duke of Buckingham is univerfally 
allowed to have been a nobleman of un 
common talents, and fo declared a patron 
of the mufes, and of the learned, that he 
was filled the Mecasnas of the age.

being a good one, and highly capable of 
relifhing beauties in the performances of 
others, which he did with great candour 
and warmth. One of the beft pieces in 
our language is his " Eflay on poetry, 
and was efteemed as fuch by Mr Addifon. 
His other pieces in verfe and profe have 
their refpeclive merit. 

MR Pope held the Duke s judgment 
in fuch high veneration, feparated from 
his quality (which he always threw afide 
in his company) that he never publifhed 
any thing for many years, till his Grace 
had firft pronounced that the author s re 
putation would run no riik by its being 
publifhed. 

MR Pope lived in fuch a perpetual 
dread of lofing that fame he had fo juflly 
acquired, that he ufed often to fay, that 
he ought to write no more, left by an un- 
fuccefsful piece, he (hould forfeit all. The 
Duke continued his friendfhip to our au 
thor to his laft moments, of whkh from

time to time he gave him many fignal 

proofs. 

His Grace expired in the month of 
February 1720, and left the following e- 
pitaph for his tomb, which may be looked 
on as an abftraft of his religion, and is a 
matter of too great curiofity not to tran- 
fcribe it here for the, entertainment of our 
readers :

thought proper to be fomewhat particular ;

fervation) from the company any .perfons

themfelves ; becaufe we imperceptibly

that by fometimes converting upon, he 
made his own, all the valuable improve

friends had acquired by ftudy and tra 
velling. 

THE famous Dr. Atterbury, Bifliop of 
Rochefter, was another faft friend to the 
tranflator of the Iliad. Mr Pope in re 
turn always retained a lively fenfe of gra 
titude, and a moft fincere affe&ion for 
him. 

DR. Atterbury, (the Bifhop of Roche- 
fter s hiftory being univerfally known, we 
(hall touch upon no more of it than what 
relates to Mr Pope s life), though a vio

proving himfelffo.

ther, Mrs. Blount, Mr Cromwell, and a 
nobleman who had made his principles 
known to Pope ; they having read toge 
ther " Lord Shaftefbury s Chara&eriftics," 
" The Religion of Nature delineated," 
and feveral books in the caufe of free in 
quiry, our author waved entering into any 
argument with the Bifliop for that time; 
and taking him afide, faid, that though 
he (Pope) was a weak advocate for his re 
ligion, yet he was fure that its orthodoxy 
and ftrength would furnifh him fufficient 
power to hazard an argument with any 
heretic, with or without a mitre. 

SUCH was the freedom fubfifting be 
tween them, that thefe words gave no of 
fence. That evening was fet afide for the 
conference, and the difputants were to 
imagine Dr. Swift prefent. 

DR. Atterbury began to read out of 
Archbifhop Tillotfon s fermons, fome of 
which he commonly had as a pocket-com 
panion. His reafon for it was, that his 
own fentiments were therein fo energi- 



48 T H E L I F E O F 

cally exprefTed, and better than he pofii- 
bly could ex tempore, or even with his 
greateft ftudy. And he thought the ar 
guments there offered fo evincing, as that 
no man, endowed with fuch ftrong intel- 
lefts as Mr Pope was, could refufe his af- 
fent to them, and deny fubfcribing to the 
many abfurdities with which popery a- 
bounds. 

AFTER having heard the Bifhop read 
Tillotfon s arguments and comment there 
on for a long time, Mr. Pope replied, that 
the Archbifhcp s cited difcourfes (which 
was the title he gave them) were only 
reafoning, and confequently could be no 
ftanciard of belief; that the quotations 
were not quite oppofite to the point his 
antagonifl: wanted to prove, for that they 
might with equal propriety be. urged by 
Catholics to fupport their arguments. 

MR Pope aflerted, moreover, that with- 
out casing away faith (of which Dr. At- 
terbury thought himfelf endowed with a 
fufficient fhaie) no human arguments were 



ALEX. POPE, Esc*. 49 

forcible enough to defeat the excellent te 
nets believed by the church of Rome, and 
by her commanded to be implicitly believed 
by all her children. 

HE farther declared, that he faw no 
more difficulty for a faithful mind to be 
lieve the Trinity, tranfufcftantiation, mi 
raculous conception, and other myfleries 
above the power of human reafon. 

HE then intreated the Dodlor to take 
into his benevolent heart the whole of the 
Chriftian fyftem, and not niggardly con- 
tent himfelf with believing but part, ifi 
difokedien ce to the Scripture, the Roman- 
catholic church, and to the endangering 
of his eternal falvation. 

NAY, fo ftrenuous a member of the 
Romifh church was Mr Pope, that he told 
Dr. Atterbury with a polite warmth, that 
if it were pofTible for any man to raife 
the dead in proof of any other religion 
than that profefTed by the fee of Rome, he 
would not change his belief. 

HE then turned to the Bimop of Ro~

all out property, and deprived of the means 
of fub lifting, provided your Lordfhip could 
be brought to think as I do. 

THE Bilhop looking on Pope as quite 
confirmed in his .erroneous perfuanon, re 
lated that conference to friend of his, a 
dignified but not a mitred -clergyman, and 
declared that he would never fpeak to 
him more on the fubjefc of religion. 
The Bifhop s zeal for the Proteftant caufe, 
in order to make fo fhining a profelyte to 
it as Mr Pope would prove, made him 
break his refolution ; for he not only fpoke 
to him afterwards, but wrote -to "him feve* 
ral times upon that topic. 

THE laft epiftle written by the Bifhop 
to Mr Pope, wherein any thing relative to 
religion is mentioned, was a letter of com 
fort on the death of Mr Pope s father. 
He therein advifed a Chriftian refignatiou

to the will of heaven, and declared im 
moderate grief for any lofs in this world* 
to be unchriftian. 

BUT the politely rebuking and cool

any farther felicitations of it to him in re 
gard to religion j bendes, Atterbury go 
ing over to the pretender s intereft foon

fon of laying down his pen, and he gave* 
the true one for laying down his " Moral

lafh was too liquorifh to be cloying. 
Though he was drawn out of the fphere 
for a while by fome more immediately in- 
terefting views, yet we (hall find him re 
turning to it again in a little time, and 
continuing to move in it till death arreft- 
cd his fteps. 

THE avowed incident which occafion- 
ed the publication of his u Letters" in 
J 737&gt; i s retailed in the preface, and the 
truth of it refts upon our author s name. 
The ftory is undeniably fomewhat intri 
cate, which caufed a fufpicion that fome 
cunning had been ufed by him ; but the 
cloud may poflibly be blown away by Dr. 
"Warburton, in his promifed hiftory of this 
friend s life. In the mean time, we muft 
content ourfelves with another reafon for 
publifhing thefc letters at this time, 
which confiders them as part of the de- 
fign of his " Magnum opus" or his 
" EfTay on Man, Ethic Epiftles, and Sa- 
e * tires. " My opinion is, fays he, that 
" there might be colle&ed from them the

" bed fyftem that ever was wrote for 
the conduct of human life, at lea ft 
" to fhame all reafonable men out of their 
* follies and vices ; and no doubt, the 
(( manner in which Mr Curll got poflcf- 
" fion of fome of them, is a flaming in- 
" ftance of the corruption of the age." 
Whatever may be thought of this reafon, 
it is certain the increafe of his purfe had 
no fmall (hare in the motives for publifh- 
ing them. Familiar letters betwixt per- 
fons of any reputation will always meet 
with readers ; and the reafon of it is well 
exprefled in thefe very letters by Lord Bo- 
lingbroke, who, in a poftfcript to one of 
Pope s to Swift, writes thus : " I feek no 
" epiftolary fame, but am a good deal 
" pleafed to think that it will be known 
" hereafter, that you and I lived in the 
(( moft friendly intimacy together. Pli- 
" ny, continues his Lordfliip, xvrit his 
" letters for the public ; fo did Seneca -, 
" fo did Balzac, Voiture, &c. Tully 
did not , and therefore thefe give us

44 more pleafure. We fee Cato, and Bru- 
* tus, and Pompey, fuch as they really 
4i were, and not fuch as the gaping mul- 
a titude of their own age took them to be, 
4&lt; or as hiilorians and poets have repre- 
4&lt; fented them to us. That is another 
41 pleafure. I remember to have feen a 
" proceflion at Aix la Chapelle, wherein 
44 an image of Charlemagne is carried on 
4t the fhoulders of a man, who is hid by 
44 the long robe of the imperial faint. 
4&lt; Follow him into the veftry, you fee the 
&lt;c bearer flip from under the robe, and the 
" gigantic figure dwindles into an image 
4f of the ordinary fize, and is fet by a- 
4&lt; mong other lumber." His LprdihipV 
remark is undeniably very juft, a^d un 
avoidably turns our eyes upon his pupil, 
who is the chief perfon concerned in it. 
Accordingly we find in thefe letters, not 
only that he had given into fome gaieties 
in his youth, as well as other poets, for 
of that he had made public confeifion long 
before : but what was at this time particu-

IN the year 17375 he fell into acquaint

commentary on the " Efiay on Man," that" 
poem was republiflied in 1740, with the 
commentary. It was at the inftance of 
this friend too, that our author added a 
fourth book to the " Dunciad;" which 
was fir ft printed feparately in the year 
1742. But the year after, the whole- 
poem came out together, as a fpecimen o 
a more correct edition of his works, which 
he had then refolved to give to the pu 
blic. And he made fome progrefs in that 
defign, but did not live to compkat it; 

THE univerfal benevolence of Mr 
Pope appears in no part of his works more 
confpicuous than his " Univerfal Prayer." 
It is imagined that he chofe the epithet 
" ugiverfal," not in any fen fe of oppofi- 
tion,tbut that it might not be deemed as 
an a& of competition with the common 
prayer ufed in proteftant churches. 

IT is to be obferved, that Mr Pope, in 
this prayer, is fo fenfible of the continual 
praife arifmg from the creation, that he 
calls upon all beings, and all the incenfe 






A L E X. ? Q P E, E s Q.. 57 

of nature, bidding it rife, at the fame time 
that he knew it was continually rifmg. 

So the Pialmift, though he knew the. 
works of the creation were praifing the 
Lord, fays, naming feveral of them, 
" Praife ye the Lord." This beautiful 
prayer is free from all uncharitable limi 
tations of the Romifh church. He in 
deed had always been, and indeed more fo 
towards the clofe of his life, a very mode 
rate man. 

THIS truly Chriftian prayer breathes 
nothing throughout but peace, charity, 
and humility ; is without any pomp in, 
the phrafe, which here was purpofely a- 
voided. It is an excellent performance 
for fo much, and worthy the ferious at- 
tention of all icligious philosophers. 

AFTER Mr. Pope had finimed all the 
abovementioned works, he gave reft to 
his pen, being able to write little, by 
reafon of the weaknefs of his eyes, and 
other bodily infirmities. Finding his 
ftrength entirely give way&gt; he began to

longed beyond his expectation, were draw

HE had all b-is life been fubjeft to an- 
habitual head-ach, and that hereditary 
complaint was now greatly increafed by a 
dropfy in his breaft, under which he ex 
pired, May 3oth, 1744, in the fifty- fixth 
year of his age. His -body was depofited, 
purfuant to his own requeft, in the fame

memory he had erefted a monument, with 
the following infcriptian written by him--

over all this fcene of man ; I muft 
allow it to be a mighty maze, but 
yet you will find it, upon proper ex 
amination, to be formed on a moft 
exact plan. It is either a wildernefs, 
where flowers and weeds grow pro- 
inifcuoufly together, or elfe it is a

tempt us from GOD. Let us there

and fee if we can find out both what 
it openly clifcovers to us, and what 
is hid under its moft fecret coverts; 
let us traverfe all its latent tracts,- 
and explore all its giddy heights;

and moot every folly as it flies; and 
catch all the living manners of the 
age, as they rife before us, wherever 
we can ; let us be candid, and laugh

GOD to all mankind,

reafon nothing either of God above, 
.or of man below, but agreeable to 
the Nation he has placed us in 
here ; and therefore we can only rea 
fon from it, or refer to it, and by this 
means draw a proper conclufion from 
our obfervations on it. For though 
GOD be known through unnumber 
ed worlds, it is our bufinefs to trace 
him only in our own. It is only he 
that can tell why Heaven has made 
us as we are ; none can account for 
this, but he, who can pierce through 
the vail immenfity, and fee worlds

obferve how one fyflem runs into

that circle other circles ; and what 
the different kinds of beings who in 
habit every itar. But the pervading 
ibul may look through the juft gra 
dations, the nice dependencies, ftrong 
commotions, the bearing and ties 
that one point has upon another, 
and fo form ar proper judgment of 
the whole. 

Is therefore the great chain, that 
draws every thing together, and 
makes them to agree, ipported by 
GOD or thyfelf ? 

II. O prefumptuous man ! couldft

FOR if it is con f eft that it requires 
infinite wifdom to formfuch a fyftem, 
where all muft be full and not inco

muft rife in due degree; then, ac 
cording to this fcale of reafoning, it 
is plain, to make the fyftern of life 
compleat, there muft befuch a thing 
as man: and therefore let us wran 
gle as long as we will, it can amount 
to no more than whether GOD has 
placed him right or wrong. 

FOR whatever we call wrong, it

lefs ikies, as for man to be ever wife, 
temperate, or calm. If plagues or

FOR who knows but his hand who 
forms the lightning, who wings the

pour fierce ambition into the hand 
of CAESAR, or may turn young AM-

Our very reafoning proceeds from 
nothing but from pride. We ac 
count for moral things in the fame 
manner we do for natural things. 
We foolifhly charge HEAVEN with 
the firft, and in the laft we acquit 
it; but the only way of proving 
our reafoning to be right, would be 
to fubmit to both.

PERHAPS it may appear to us, 
that there was nothing in this world 
but all harmony and virtue; that 
both the air and the ocean never felt 
the wind ; and that there never was 
any paflion at all to ruilie and dif- 
compofe the mind.. But as NATU RE 
fubfifts by the ftrife of the elements 
fo our paffions are the very elements 
which fupport our life. For NA 
TURE has always kept the fame ge 
neral order in man, iince the be 
ginning of the world. * 

VI. Now therefore what would 
this man be ? When he looks up 
ward, though HEAVEN has made 
him but a little lefs than the angels, 
-fct he flill would be more : and when 
he looks downward, he is ilill as 
much grieved and difcontented, be- 
caufe GOD has not given him the 



i 6 E S S A Y O N M A N. 

fame ftrength that a bull has, and, 
the fame furred cloatlis that the 
bear has. But as all creatures were 
originally made for the ufe of man, 
they would be of none to him, 
had he the qualifications of every 
one of them centered in his own 
perfon: for NATURE has been kind 
to all the animal creation, without 
any manner of profusion ; me has af- 
figned every one of tk*m proper 
powers, and proper organs j and e- 
very feeming want of courfe is com- 
penfated ; to one kind me has given 
fwiftnefs, without ftrength, to o- 
thers great force and ftrength : eve 
ry thing is in exact proportion, fo 
that they need no addition to their 
different qualifications, nor is there, 
any neceffity for the taking any 
thing from them. Every beaft, and 



ESSAY ON MAN. 17 

every infecl, is happy in its own na 
ture : has heaven been only unkind 
to man ? And fliall he, who is the 
only one of the rational creation, 
Be pleafcd with nothing that GOD 
has given him, becaufe he has not 
all the qualifications of the brute cre 
ation centered in himfelf ? 

THE only blifs that was defigned 
for human kind, (if pride could find 
that blefling) was not to act or to 
think above the powers that GOD 
had given them, and not to be defi- 
rous of any other perfection, but 
what both his nature, and the ftatc. 
of his condition here below could 
bear. 

THE plain reafon that man has 
not a microfcopic eye, is, becaufe he 
is not a fly : for of what ufe w r ould 
it be to him, if he had finer optics,.

to drfcern a mite, when at the fame 
time he could not comprehend Hea 
ven ? Or if he was tremblingly a- 
live all over, he would fmart and a- 
gonize at every pore at the flighteft 
touch : or if his fmell was fo very 
quick, as to dart eiHuvia through his 
brain, the fragrant fmell of a rofe 
might make him die in aromatic pain; 
if NATURE was to thunder in his o~ 
pgn years, and lain him with the 
mufic of the fpheres, he would ra 
ther wifli that Heaven had made him 
content with the purling rill, and 
the whifpering zephyr. But e- 
very thinking perfon will always 
find, that Providence is as good in 
what it denies, as in what it gives.

from the luxury of Learning, which 
is but Vanity and Drefs, and ferve 
only as tricks to ihew the ftretch 
of the human brain, being no more 
than mere curious pleafure or inge 
nious pain ;. therefore either ex 
punge the whole, or lop off the ex- 
crefcent parts of all the arts which 
our vices have created, and then 
you will fee how little true merit 
there has been, which has ferved 
all the paft time of life, and what 
remains, to ferve the time that is to 
come. 

II. FOR there are two principles 
that always reign in human nature, 
viz. felf-love, to urge us to purfue 
every thing that is good, and rea- 
fon, to reftrain us from every thing 
that is evil ; and each of thofe 
works move towards its proper end, 



ES SAY ON MAN. 33 

in governing every one of us, and 
we muft always afcribe every thing 
that is good to the right governing 
of our paflions, and every thing that 
is evil, by not ruling them accord 
ing to the di&ates of right reafon. 
SELF-LOVE is always the fpring of 
motion that actuates the foul, but 
it muft be reafon that muft give the 
balance to the whole. Man could 
not attend to any action, were it not 
for this, and if it were not for 
this, man would be active without 
any fufficient end : he would be 
juft like a plant that is fixed to a 
particular fpot, from whence he 
ihould draw nutrition, to propagate 
his fpecies, and then rot; or, like 
the lawlefs flame of a meteor, which 
runs through every void, deftroy- 
ing all before it, till it is deftroyed 
B 5 



34 E S SAY GIST MAN. 

by itfelf. The moving principle 
requires our ftrength to prompt,, 
impel, and infpire it with activity : 
but it muft be ruled byreafon alone, 
which muft be fedate and quiet, as it 
is formed to alleviate and ad vile us, 
and to be a check upon our other 
pailions. Self-love acts ftronger, 
according as it fees the object of its 
wiihes nigh at hand; but Reafoa 
fits at a diftance, and views the 
future confequences of things : 
whereas felf-love is actuated only by 
the fenfe of a prefent good. For 
let us be as watchful as ever we 
will, temptations throng fafter a- 
bout us than we can furnrnon up 
arguments againft them, Reafon 
mail always therefore be upon its 
guard, to fufpend the force of the 
temptation ; and, by a clofe atten-, 



ES SAY ON MAN. 35 

tion, it will acquire a ftronger ha 
bit, and more experience, and his 
reafon will be fo much ftrengthen- 
ed, as to reftrain the fallies of felf- 
love. Let fubtle fchoolrnen, who 
generally are more ftudious to di 
vide than unite mankind j and 
Grace, Virtue, Senfe, and Reafon, 
with all the ralh dexterity of wit, 
fplit. Wits are juft like fools, fre 
quently at war about a name, 
which often has the fame meaning, 
and fometimes no meaning at all. 
Self-love and Reafon both afpire at 
one end ; for pain is the averfion, 
and pleafure the deiire of both. 
Self-love is greedy to devour its ob 
ject, and to tafte the honey, with 
out wounding the flower of Rea 
fon ; both pleafure and pain, if we 
rightly underflood them, are either: 
B 6 



36 ESS A YON MAN. 

our greateft evil, or our greatefi 
good. 

III. WE may call the paflions no 
more than fo many modes of felf- 
iove, as it is either a feeming, or a 
real good, that moves them all ~ 
but linee we cannot divide every 
good thing amongft others, Reafon 
bids us provide for ourielvesj and 
though our pafiions be felfifli, yet 
when they are employed for proper 
ends, and lifted under the banner 
of Reafon, they tend to exalt na 
ture to the practice of every virtue. 
STOICS may boaft that virtue 
conlifts in a freedom from every 
paflion, and an infenfibility to every 
pain, and therefore their virtue is 
contracted, and retires to their own 
breaft, and is fixed there, as if it 
were frozen : but ftrength of mind 



ESSAY ON MAN. 37 

is exercife, and not reft ; for the 
rifmg temped puts the foul into ac 
tion, and though it may commit 
a ravage upon a part, yet it pre- 
ierves the whole. As we ail fail 
in ,a different manner on the vail 
ocean of life, Ileafon mud be the 
card by which we muft freer, but 
Paffion muft be the gale to waft us 
through it ; for we do not find 
GOD always in the dill calm, he 
fometimes mounts the ftorm, and 
walks upon the wind. 

TH E paffions are like the elements, 
though they are born to fight, yet 
when they are mixed, and foftened, 
they unite together in good works : 
it is enough for us only to temper 
and employ them ; for whatever 
compofes, can likewife deflroy man. 
Let it fuffice then, that Ileafon fub- 



3 S ESSAY ON MAN. 

jecls and compounds them in fuch 
a manner, as to follow the road of 
Nature, which is the law of GOD. 
For all the train of fair-foiling 
Pleafure, Love, Hope and Joy, 
when mixed with Hate, Fear, and 
Grief, which are the family of 
Pain, make and maintain an equal 
balance in the mind : thefe, like 
lights and fhades in painting, give all 
the ftrength and colour to our life. 
WE always have pleafure either 
in our hands or our eyes, and when 
they ceafe in the action, they rife in 
the profpecl. It is the whole em 
ployment of the body and the mind 
to grafp at the prefent, or to hope for 
the future; thofe are continually 
fpreading all their charms, though 
they do not charm every one alike; 
for different fenfes ftrike more force- 



ESSAY ON MAN. 39 

ably on one paiTion than another, 
and therefore, agreeable to the weak- 
nefs or ftrength of the organ on which 
they ftrike. Every man has a MAS 
TER PASSION in his breaft, which, 
like AARON S ferpent, fwallows up 
all the other paffions. 

As Man, perhaps the very firft 
moment that he breathes, imbibes 
the lurking principle, which grows 
up with him in life, till it at length 
fubdues him, fo it is the difeafe of 
the mind, that the RULING PASSION 
feeds the whole of every vital hu 
mour; for as the mind opens, and 
fpreadsits functions, whateverwarms 
the heart, or fills the head, imagina 
tion employs her dangerous art in 
pouring it conftantly on the peccant 
part. 

NATURE being its mother, and 



40 E S S A Y O N M A N. 

Habit its nurfe, Wit, Spirit, and Fa 
culties only tend to make it worfe ; 
for Reafon itfelf gives it only more 
power and edge, as the fun, thebleii 
beam of heaven, makes vinegar more 
four. 

WE only are wretched fubjeds, 
though it be to the lawful fway of 
this weak queen; and if me does not 
lend us arms, as well as rules, me 
tells us in facl that we are no more 
than fools. She teaches us only to 
mourn our nature, but not to mend 
it ; though me be a fharp^accufer, 
me is but a helplefs friend ; me turns 
from a judge to a pleader, to per- 
fuade us to make a choice, or tojuf- 
tify it when it is made, being all a- 
long proud of an eafy conqueft. She 
only removes the weaker paffions, 
that the ftronger may take place i 



E SSAY O N M AN. 41 

in the fame manner as when fmall 
pains and humours turn into a gout, 
the do&or imagines that he has dri 
ven them out of the body. 

YES, the road of Nature muft e- 
ver be preferred; for Reafon is ftill 
a guard, though it be no guide ; and 
it is hers to rectify, and not over 
throw, and to treat this paflion more 
like a friend than like a foe. It is 
a mightier power that fends this 
flong direction, and impels feveral 
men to feveral ends: Juft like the 
varying winds, to by their paffions, 
this conflantly drives them to a cer 
tain coaft. Whether gold, glory, 
knowledge, power, or the love of 
eafe, pleafe, every one follows his dar 
ling paflion, though at the expence 
of his life fc for the merchant ia his 
toiling finds reafoa on his fide, in the 



4* ESSAYONMA N. 

fame manner as do the pride of the 
hero, the indolence of the fage, and 
the humility of the monk. 

THE eternal art of educing good 
from evif^grafts on this paflion our 
beft principle : it is thus that the Mer 
cury of man is fixed, and the virtue 
grows flrong, which is mixed with 
his nature; for by this means the 
drofs cements, what elfe would be 
too refined, and fo the body and 
mind a& together in one intereft. 

As fruits, which are ungrateful 
to the planter for all his care, by his 
ingrafting them on ftocks which are 
foreign, he learns them to bear; 
thus the fureft and moft fubftantial 
virtuesihootfrom thepaffions, when 
the vigour of wild nature works at 
the root of them. Only obfeive

reed from fpleen, obftinacy, hatred, 
and fear ! fee how anger and forti 
tude fupply the want of zeal, ava 
rice, prudence, floth, and philofophy ; 
luft, when it is refined through 
fome certain drainers, is no more 
than gentle love, and pleafes all wo 
mankind ; and envy, which is a {lave 
in the ignoble mind, is no more 
than imitation in the learned or 
brave; and there is no virtue that 
we can mention, but what will ei : 
ther grow on pride or flume. 

BUT let it always be a check up 
on our pride, that Nature gives us 
only that which is neareft allied to 
our vices : it is therefore the byas 
of nature, that muft produce good 
from evil; for NERO, if he would, 
might have reigned as illuftrioufly 
as TITUS. The ery foul, which 



44 E S S A Y O N M A N. 

was abhorred in a CATILINE, charm, 
ed in DECIUS, and was divine in 
CUR/TIUS : the fame ambition can 
either deftroy or fave, and make a 
patriot as well as it makes a knave. 

IT is therefore the GOD within 
the mind that mirft divide this light 
and darknefs&gt; which are joined 
within us. Extremes in nature 
produce equal ends in man, and 
join together for fome myflerious- 
life ; and though each by turns in 
vade the other s bounds, yet they 
often mix : as in well -wrought 
pictures, the lights and the fhades 
fet off each other, fo where thofe 
are mixed, it is very difficult to ob- 
ferve where Virtue ends, or Vice 
begins. 

THEY are fools, who fall into the 
notion, that there is neither Vice 



ESSAY ON MAN. 45 

nor Virtue. It is the fame as if 
you would blend black and white a 
thoufand different ways, fo that the 
colour could net be eafily difcern- 
ed ; yet this will never make it ap 
pear that there is neither black nor 
white : for if you will only con- 
fult your own heart, you will find 
nothing is fo plain ; thofe that think 
otherwife, take a deal of time and 
pains to work themfelves into the 
belief of it. 

VICE is a monfter of fo frightful 
a mien, that it requires no more 
than a perfect fight of it to make it 
hated. Yet if we fee it too often, 
we become familiar with her face 5 
and by this means w r e firft endure 
the fight, then pity the perfon in 
whom it appears ; and frequently 
at laft embrace it ourfelves. But 



46 ESS AY ON MAN. 

we never are agreed about the ex 
tremes of vice. The fame, as when 
you afk, where is the North ? you 
are told at YORK, that it is on the 
TWEED ; when there, they tell you 
it is in SCOTLAND; there, in the 
ORCADES, GREENLAND, ZEMBLA, 
or the Lord knows where. So no 
creature owns vice in its firft de 
gree, but ftill thinks his neighbour 
farther gone in it than he ; yet that 
very degree, which happier natures 
flirink at with all the marks of the

that he is moving to, but HEAVEN 
has one great view in all, and that

that which counteracts each folly

effects that every vice would have ; 
and that applies happy frailties to 
all the different ranks of mankind ; 
it is that which gives fhame to the

exalt itfelf even upon Vanity, which 
feeks no intereft, but the reward of

and glory of mankind is built on 
the wants and defects of the mind. 
IT was Heaven that ordained 
that each fliould depend on the o- 
ther, and be either as a mafter, a 
fervant, or a friend, and bids each 
call upon the other for afliftance ; 
for GOD makes even evil produc 
tive of good ; fo that even our 
wants, our frailties, and paffions, 
make it our common intereft, and 
endears the tie that Nature has 
bound us with. It is frequently to 
our very wants and infirmities that 
we are indebted for true friendlhip,

then no need for War to ravifli, nor 
no treafure for Rapine to invade.

peribn who either diffufed bleffings, 
or warded off miieries, the fame 
which makes the fons obey their 
fires, that made a prince the father 
of a people. 

VI. TILL then, each patriarch, 
crowned by Nature, fat the king, 
prieft, and parent of his growing 
ilate ; they hung on him, as their 
fecond providence, his eye was their 
law, and his tongue their oracle. 
He called the food from the wonder

for him as a man : and then looking 
up from iire to lire, they explored

The faith of this plain tradition, that 
this All began, they conveyed un

was known diftinetty from the work, 
and fimple Reafon never fought but

that fteddy light, man, like his Ma 
ker, faw that all was right ; and 
trod in the paths of Virtue to Plea- 
fure, and when he owned a GOD, 
owned him as a Father. All the 
faith and allegiance then is Love j 
for Nature knew no divine right in 
man, and could fear no ill in GOD ; 
and underftood no other fove- 
reign but a fovereign good. True 
faith and policy ran united together,

the one being the love of GOD, the 
other that of man, 

WHO was it that firft taught un 
done realms, and fouls enflaved, that 
enormous article of faith, that many 
were made for one ; that proud ex 
ception to all the laws of Nature, to 
invert the world, and even to work

Conqueft, and Conqueft that made 
Law; till Superftition taught the 
people to reverence the tyrant, then 
lhared the tyranny, and lent it aid, 
making Gods of conquerors, and 
ilaves of fubjecls : She availed felf 
of the blaze of the lightning, and 
the found of the thunder, when 
the mountains rocked, and when the 
ground groaned ; it was me who 
taught the weak to bend, and the

and far mightier than they : She faw 
from the burfting ikies and rending 
earth the Gods defcend, and infernal 
fiends arife : here me fixed the 
dreadful, and there the bleft abodes; 
All .the notion me had of devils, 
proceeded wholly from fear; and 
the weak hope me had made her 
believe a GOD, whofe attributes me 
imagined to be rage, revenge, and 
luft ; fuch as the heathen Gods and 
conquerors were. It was a blind 
furious zeal, and not the fweet bond 
of Charity, that became their guide ; 
and their fpite dictated to them a 
hell for their enemies and oppofers, 
and their pride was fo great, that 
.they difdained even to go to Hea

Flamen tailed living food; after 
which he fmeared his idol over with 
human blood ; he fhook the world 
below with heaven s thunders, and 
made even his GOD an engine a- 
gainfl his foe. 

So it is that Self-love drives the 
man to things juft or unjuft, to one 
man s ambition, lucre, or luft : and 
the fame felf-love it is that becomes 
the caufe of retraining the whole 
human race, though it is fometimes 
pretended to be the .government 
and the laws. For if every one 
was to like the fame as another, a 
weaker perfon might rob them of it 
by furprize, or a ftronger take it by 
open force &gt; therefore his fafety both 



E S S A Y ON M AN. 75 

fieeping and awake muft depend 
upon the laws, which make each 
man the guardian of his private 
property. Self-defence having for 
ced all men into virtue, this made 
even kings learn juftice and bene 
volence : Self-love forfook the path 
it firft purfued, arid found that its 
own private intereft was only to 
be fecured by the public good. 

IT was then that both the flu- 
dious head and the generous mind, 
the follower of GOD, or friend to 
the human kind, whether poet or 
patriot, rofe only to reftore that 
faith and moral, which Nature had 
given before; they did not kindle a 
new light, but relumed the ancient 
one of Nature ; if they could not 
make GOD S image, yet they drew 
a fhadow of it: It was this that

neither too much to ilacken nor to

tuned inilrument, which, when you 
touch one firing, muft ftrike the o- 
ther alfo, and muft make every

is the great harmony of the world, 
that fprings from order, union, and 
full confent of things : when both 
fmall and great, weak and mighty, 
were made to ferve, not to fuffer, 
to ftrengthen, and not to invade; 
makes each more powerful, as need 
ful to the reft, and is itfelf bleft in 
proportion as it blefles others, and 
brings to one central point beaft, 
man, angel, fervant, lord, or king. 
LET then only fools conteft for

forms of government ; for whatever 
is beft adminiftred is beft : let grace- 
lets zealots fight for modes of faith; 
for the man s faith can never be 
wrong which produces a good life. 
Though the world may difagrcc 
with regard to the objects of faith 
and hope, yet all the race of man 
kind s concern is Charity : every 
thing that thwarts this great end 
mutt be falfe ; and every thing

happier, or mends their morals.

lives by fupport, and gains ftrength 
by the kindly afMance he gives to

IF you afk of the learned the way,

ferve, the other to fhun mankind. 
Some place their happinefsin action,

all the indulgencies of eafe and fu- 
pinenefs j fome in pleafure, and o- 
thers in what they call content 
ment ; fome are fo funk in brutrfh 
pleafures, as frequently to find their 
delight end in pain ; fome are fo 
i welled with pride, as to defpife 
even virtue, and call it vain ; or 
elfe they grow indolent, and fall to 
an e xtreme of trufting in every 
thing, or doubting of all. 

THEY who thus define it, come 
to no other conclufion than this, 
that happinefs is happinefs. 

TAKE Nature s path, and leave

will find, when the caufes and ends 
of every thing are known, that hea 
ven made the one to ferve the thou 
fand. For Heaven thus breathes 
through every member of the 
whole, as one common foul. And 
if Fortune s gifts were pofleiTed 
alike by each, it is plain that GOD 
could never place content in exter

each expects to poileis in the next

On ye fons of men ! will ye flill

KNOW then, that all the good 
GOD or Nature ever meant, or indi 
viduals poffefs, was meant to mere

Peace in Virtue ; for the good and 

the bad equally gain the goods of 
Fortune ; but they rifk the moft in 
Fortune, who take bad means to 
obtain it. Whether docs Vice or. 
Virtue meet with contempt or com- 
pailion firft? for when you count 
all the advantage that profperous 
Vice attains to, it is nothing but 
what Virtue flies from and difclaims ; 
and when you grant all the happi- 
nefs to the bad they would chufe to 
have, they muft want one, which 
is to pafs for good. 

THOSE are blind to truth, and 
GOD S whole fcheme of providence

gives happinefs to Vice, and mifery 
to Virtue. But thofe who follow 
the great fcheme of God s provi

it is only fools who call the good 
unhappy, for any evil that may 
happen to them from the common 
occurrences of life. See the vir

whence did all this proceed from, 
their virtue, or their contempt of

WHAT is it that makes all phy-

the firft, and the will wanders in 
the laft. For if it be rightly under- 
flood, GOD never fends any ill ; 
partial ill is univerfal good; for 
Heaven feldom lets Nature fall 
fhort of its purpofe, till man has 
improved or mifimproved it. We 
might with as- much wifdom com 
plain of Heaven, that righteous A-

BUT the fair prize of Virtue lies 
in the foul s calm funfhine, and the 
heart-felt joy, which nothing on 
earth can give, and it is not in the

ftroy. If you would fix a better, 
then give Humility a coach-and-fix,

Thofe are rewards that would bring 
no joy to Virtue, nay, rather would 
deflroy it : for how often have thofe

that the one can conquer, and the 
other can cheat; it is ftill moft ab-

or the knave. But he who obtains 
noble ends by noble means, or if 
he fail in this, fmiles in exile, of

like SOCRATES, that man is great

Why, it is to know how little can

to drudge in arts ; without a fecond, 
your heart may itfelf be the judge ; 
for if you would teach truths, thofe

The DYING CHRISTIAN 
To his SOUL. 

OH Thou vital fpark of heavenly 
extraction ! who art conftant- 
ly trembling, hoping, flying ! Ceafe, 
fond Nature, Oh ceafe thy ftrife, 
and let me feel the blifs of dying, 
and languifh into life. Hark, how 
the angels whifper ! they fay, Sifter 
fpirit, come away ! what can it be 
that thus quite abforbs me, that 
fteals away my fenfes, and fhuts 
my fight? that drowns my fpirits, 
and draws away rny breath ? Oh, 
tell me, my foul ! can this be death ? 
the world now recedes and difap- 
pears ; my eyes obferve the heavens

gels ! lend me your wings. I find my- 
felf mounting, I fly ! O grave 1 where 
is now thy vidory ? O Death ! where 
is now thy fling ?
